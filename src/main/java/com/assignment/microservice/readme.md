I believe all of the needed spring and aws classes are connected now. The issue I'm having is that the running of the application keeps hanging up on needed a variety of additional libraries (most specifically from Jackson).  Is this the reference you made to the spring annotations library? In any event, it feels like I could be chasing libraries all day to have them all included and I feel like there is a better way.

I think the code to upload the file will work, once I get the issue with the libraries resolved.

I will send an email with the jar files attached that I have had to add to the class path so far.

Thanks again - I'm learning a lot about the application framework through this project.
