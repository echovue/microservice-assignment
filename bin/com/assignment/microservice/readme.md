I understand the process from the standpoint of how the connections to AWS are supposed to work, how the bucket is accessed, and how the file is sent/received.  The issue I was having is that the libraries were not being recognized inside the project.  I know this is an issue somehow within the build.gradle file and my local environment but I'm currently at a loss as to why the libraries aren't being recognized. I'm not giving up by any stretch, but just giving a status update.  I will keep looking into it on my own.  Your task made sense to me and I was able to find good documentation on getting it connected to AWS.
